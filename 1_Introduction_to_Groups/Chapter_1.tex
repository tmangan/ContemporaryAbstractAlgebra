%%%% ONE %%%%
\question
With words, describe each symmetry in $D_3$ (the set of symmetries of an equilateral triangle).


%%%% TWO %%%%
\question 
Write out a complete Cayley table for $D_3$. 


%%%% THREE %%%%
\question 
Is $D_3$ Abelian?


%%%% FOUR %%%%
\question 
Describe in words the elements of $D_5$ (symmetries of a regular pentagon).


%%%% FIVE %%%%
\question 
For $n\geq 3$, describe the elements of $D_n$. \textit{(Hint: Consider two cases - n even and n odd.)} 
How many elements does $D_n$ have?


%%%% SIX %%%%
\question 
In $D_n$, explain geometrically why a reflection followed by a reflection must be a rotation.


%%%% SEVEN %%%%
\question 
In $D_n$, explain geometrically why a rotation followed by a rotation must be a rotation.


%%%% EIGHT %%%%
\question 
In $D_n$, explain geometrically why a rotation and a reflection taken together in either order must be a reflection.


%%%% NINE %%%%
\question 
Associate the number $+1$ with a rotation and the number $-1$ with a reflection. Describe an analogy between 
multiplying these two numbers and multiplying elements of $D_n$.


%%%% TEN %%%%
\question 
If $r_1,r_2,$ and $r_3$ represent rotations from $D_n$ and $f_1,f_2,$ and $f_3$ represent reflections from $D_n$, 
determine whether $r_1r_2f_1r_3f_2f_3r_3$ is a rotation or a reflection.



%%%% ELEVEN %%%%
\question 
Find elements $A$, $B$, and $C$ in $D_4$ such that $AB=BC$ but $A\neq C$. (Thus, "cross cancellation" is not valid.)


%%%% TWELVE %%%%
\question 
Explain what the following diagram proves about the group $D_n$.


%%%% THIRTEEN %%%%
\question 
Describe the symmetries of a nonsquare rectangle. Construct the corresponding Cayley table.


%%%% FOURTEEN %%%%
\question 
Describe the symmetries of a parallelogram that is neither a rectangle nor a rhombus. Describe the symmetries of 
a rhombus that is not a rectangle.


%%%% FIFTEEN %%%%
\question 
Describe the symmetries of a noncircular ellipse. Do the same for a hyperbola.


%%%% SIXTEEN %%%%
\question 
Consider an infinitely long strip of equally spaced H's:
$$...\text{ H H H H }...$$
Describe the symmetries of this strip. Is the group of symmetries of the strip Abelian?


%%%% SEVENTEEN %%%%
\question 
For each of the snowflakes in the figure, find the symmetry group and locate the axes of reflective symmetry.


%%%% EIGHTTEEN %%%%
\question 
Determine the symmetry group of the outer shell of the cross section of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).


%%%% NINETEEN %%%%
\question 
Does an airplane propeller have a cyclic symmetry group or a dihedral symmetry group?


%%%% TWENTY %%%%
\question 
Bottle caps that are pried off sypically have 22 ridges around the rim. Fine the symmetry group of such a cap.


%%%% TWENTY ONE %%%%
\question 
What group theoretic property do upper-case letters F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, R have that is not shared by the 
remaining upper-case letters in the alphabet?


%%%% TWENTY TWO %%%%
\question 
For each design below, determine the symmetry group.


%%%% TWENTY THREE %%%%
\question 
What would the effect be if a six-bladed ceiling fan were designed so that the centerlines of two of the blades were at 
$70^o$ angle and all the other blades were set at $58^o$ angle?
